#Astraeus

This is the github repo of the West Virginia University SRAD avionics project named Astraeus.

Astreaus is a student led project to develop cheap, open-source, and modular avionics. The goal is to create electronics for out competition rocket and for student use on personal rockets. 

Astraeus is the greek god of the wind and dusk to match not only the idea of our avionics being on a rocket but also our competition rocket being named "Dark and Dusty" after the song Country Roads
